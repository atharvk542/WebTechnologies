              >Mad Libs is a phrasal template word game where one player prompts
              others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story,
              before reading the often comical or nonsensical story aloud. The
              game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. The
              game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million
              copies of Mad Libs books have been sold since the series was first
              published in 1958.</i
